            <p><strong>Course Description</strong><br>Games and play are deeply embedded in human culture. Play suggests a broad range of human experiences with universal qualities not easily contained by a common form. Games use their playable form to reflect contemporary culture and speak to the cultural spaces in which they reside. There is freedom in play. There is structure in games. How do they work together? This course explores how games structure play to serve their purpose, and how play inspires games to push against expectations of popular culture of what games are, or are not. Informed by perspectives in game studies and theories of play, students will study a variety of analog and digital games to consider the varied structures that shape a play experience. The practical digital component of the class utilizes the Unity game engine to put students in the role of both game designer and developer. Hands-on projects allow students to experiment with building a game experience capable of conveying meaning and message, and expressing aspects of humanity beyond contest and conflict. Programming experience is required.</p>

            <p><strong>Teaching &amp; Learning Methodology</strong><br>This course uses an active-learning approach that joins critical inquiry and an iterative design process to introduce students to meaningful play experiences. The iterative process encourages learning through exploration and experimentation while guiding students through the progressive stages of game design and development as a creative practice. Classes cover theoretical foundations and technical instruction, and include lectures, discussions, case studies, workshops, group work, and presentations. Outside of the class students will engage in individual and group work that examine play in a variety of social and cultural contexts. Group collaboration and investigation are fundamental components of this course. The overall intention is for students to develop the critical and practical skills necessary to create and evaluate games as a medium for communication and expression.</p>

            <p><strong>Attendance</strong></p>
            <ul style="list-style-type: none; text-align: left;">
            <li style="list-style-type: square;">Attendance in all classes is mandatory. Be on time and ready to start work at the posted start time. Arriving more than five minutes late to class will count as an unexcused absence.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: square;">Unexcused absences or habitual lateness will negatively impact your final grade for the class. If you know you are going to be late or absent, please email me in advance. If you have an emergency, let me know as soon as you can.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: square;">More than one unexcused absence will result in a 5-percentage point drop in your attendance grade per absence. After four unexcused absences, you will fail the class.</li>
            </ul>
            <hr>
            <p><strong>Participation</strong></p>
            <ul style="list-style-type: none; text-align: left;">
            <li style="list-style-type: square;">Class participation is essential. The study of play requires hands-on experience with the object of study, as well as analysis and discussion in the course of playing.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: square;">Students are expected to attend ALL classes and be actively engaged. Contributing to class discussions and offering advice, input, feedback, etc during class is a major part of your grade. Participating in class is helpful for me to get to know you as an individual and keep track of your progress. Equally importantly, it provides you and your classmates the opportunity to learn from each other through the sharing of failures, successes, and insights on the work you are doing.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: square;">Be prepared to work in groups in class and for assigned projects, and to support classmates with playtesting and feedback outside of class. Being a thoughtful and generous critic helps you become critical in your own creative practice.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: square;">All assignments must be turned in on time. For playable projects, be ready to present your work at the start of the class on the day the project is due. Each day an assignment is late will result in a lower assignment grade (i.e. B+ to B).</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: square;">Ask questions—in class, outside of class, or through emails. Let me know if you have any concerns about the course or if you would like extra help. You can email me, stop by my office, ask for a scheduled meeting, or speak with me before or after class.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: square;">You are responsible for making up material missed due to an absence.</li>
